# p2pnet

An experimental peer-to-peer network. I have **no idea** what I am doing, hence the need for this project. 
  
I could have used [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) and that would have been amazing but I decided not to for several reasons:
- Rusty libp2p has no testing framework
- The library lacks real-world experience and is fairly experimental
- It's quite a big library so it's hard to fully understand how it works
- I want to be able to overoptimize things
- I fear I could get blocked by missing features
- It's a learning project after all, why would I want to use a library?
