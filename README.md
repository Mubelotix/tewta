<p align="center">Experimental peer-to-peer social network built with Rust ðŸ¦€</p>

An experimental peer-to-peer network using [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) as its [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table).

The end goal is to achieve a fully functional distributed clone of Twitter.

## Non-goals

- Care about NAT traversal. Users gotta have to fix their shitty network settings.*
- Implement username claiming. [ENS](https://ens.domains/) is fine.
- Service-wide moderation service. Users will moderate their own profile, and that's all.
- Decentralized search engine*

_* It's a non-goal for me, but *you* can PR._

## Why not use libp2p?
  
I could have used [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) and that would have been amazing, but I decided not to for several reasons:
- Rusty libp2p has no testing framework
- The library lacks real-world experience and is fairly experimental
- It's quite a big library, so it's hard to fully understand how it works
- I want to be able to overoptimize things
- I fear I could get blocked by missing features
- It's a learning project after all, why would I want to use a library?
