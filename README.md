<p align="center">Experimental peer-to-peer social network built with Rust ðŸ¦€</p>

An experimental peer-to-peer network using [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) as its [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table).

The end goal is to achieve a fully functional distributed clone of Twitter.

## Non-goals

- Care about NAT traversal. Users gotta have to fix their shitty network settings.*
- Implement username claiming. [ENS](https://ens.domains/) is fine.
- Service-wide moderation service. Users will moderate their own profile, and that's all.
- Decentralized search engine*

_* It's a non-goal for me, but *you* can PR._

## FAQ

### Why not using libp2p?

I could have used [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) and that would have been amazing, but I decided not to for several reasons:
- Rusty libp2p has no testing framework
- The library lacks real-world experience and is still solely experimental
- I fear we could get blocked by missing features
- Building everything from scratch allows us to optimize as much as needed

### Why Kademlia?

[Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) is simple and works well.
It is important for an open protocol to be easy to understand.  
Note that this implementation is not compatible with other Kademlia nodes.
The concept remains but the design has been adapted to this project.
